# NIELIT-Delhi-A-Level-Major-Project
This is NIELIT A-Level Major Project (Car Price Prediction on Car Dekho Dataset using Machine Learning). <br/><br/>
The Car Price Prediction project seeks to develop a machine learning model to estimate the value of used cars. 
In a market where determining fair prices for pre-owned vehicles can be challenging, this project aims to alleviate this concern for buyers, sellers, and dealerships. 
It will collect and preprocess a comprehensive dataset of used car listing, including crucial attributes like make, model, years, mileage, location, and price. 
Through feature engineering and selection, the model will consider a wide range of factors that influence car prices.
